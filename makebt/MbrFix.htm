            <h3>Usage:</h3>
            <PRE>
    MbrFix /drive &lt;num&gt; {/partition &lt;part&gt;} &lt;command&gt; { /yes } { /byte }
</PRE>
            <h3>Requirements:</h3>
        <P>The program is made for Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 
            2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows PE. Both 32-bit and 64-bit x64 editions are supported.</P>
        <P>You need administrative privileges to make it work!</P>
        <H3>
            Purpose:</H3>
            <p>
                Perform several Master Boot Record (MBR) tasks, like backing up, restoring, fixing
                the boot code in the MBR, etc. The utility should <b>not</b> be used for GUID Partition
                Table (GPT) disks. The utility now, by popular demand, also come in a x64-version
                running unde x64-editions of Windows and PE.</p>

        <P></P>
        <p>
            Drive numbering &lt;num&gt; starts on 0.<br />
            Partition numbering &lt;part&gt; starts on 1.</p>
        <p>
            Commands restorembr, fixmbr, generatesignature, writestate, clean, setactivepartition and
            fixbootsector will ask for confirmation unless /yes is included. 
            All these commands may lead to data loss if used incorrectly or without intention.</p>
        <p>
            If the /byte option is given for the readsignature command, the signature is 
            returned as a byte array instead of as a DWORD.
            Writesignature requires the new signature to be specified as 8 hex digits.</p>
        <p>
		    If /vista is used with the fixmbr command, a Windows Vista MBR is written,
		    if /win7 is used, a Windows 7 MBR is written instead of the default
		    Win2000/XP/2003 MBR.  The Vista or Win7 MBR should work with the other OS'es.</p>
        <p>
            When fixing boot sector of a chosen partition, the wanted OS version must be specified.
            For now, the only valid choices are WIN98, DOS5 and DOS6.<br />
            The purpose of the fixbootsector command is to insert boot code for loading DOS
            from a partition created and formatted as FAT using the Windows 2000/XP/2003 tools,
            since those tools inserts boot code for loading NTLDR.</p>
		<P>
        <H3>Return codes:</H3>
        <P>
            The program reports an errorlevel as 0 for OK and other values for errors.<br>
            The exception to this is the ReadState, GetPartitonType and GetActivePartitions
            command which returns the state as a 
            return code as well as printing to stdout. Any errors for this command&nbsp;are 
            returned as negative values because of this. The DriveSize command returns 
            the&nbsp;drive size in MB, and 0 in case of error.
        </P>
        <h3>Why do I need this utility?</h3>
        <P>Well, I was testing Windows Embedded XP using a virtual PC, and was booting 
            Windows PE from a CD-ROM to partition a brand new harddisk (quite cheap, since 
            it was virtual <STRONG><EM>!</EM></STRONG>). Using the diskpart.exe utility 
            (found in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, available as a download for 
            Windows 2000), I created the partition, made it Active, assigned it a drive 
            letter. I then used the format.exe utility to format it to NTFS (format C: 
            /fs:ntfs).</P>
        <pre>DISKPART&gt; detail part
Partition 1
Type: 07
Hidden: No
Active: Yes

 Volume ###  Letter  Lable       Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info.
 ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------   ---------  --------
* Volume 1     C    WinXP        NTFS   Partition    149 MB   OK        System            
            </pre>
        <P>I then mounted a network drive to my physical computer and copied the boot.ini, 
            ntldr, ntdetect.com, windows folder, program files folder, etc. from the 
            Windows Embedded XP image directory. Everything to make it boot.</P>
        <P>Well everything should be OK, so I rebooted the (virtual) computer and expected 
            it to boot up Windows Embedded XP.</P>
        <P>But not so! It just sat there with a nice black screen. No error message at all.</P>
        <P>Some investigation later on the Internet, I found this very informative page by 
            Daniel B. Sedory: <A href="http://thestarman.narod.ru/asm/mbr/index.html#MBR">
                http://thestarman.narod.ru/asm/mbr/index.html</A>, 
            containing a wealth of MBR info. The info on one of the pages states that the 
            MBR code is installed on the drive when the Windows setup program runs and no 
            MBR code exists already. Hmm.., seemed to be&nbsp;right on the mark.</P>
        <P>I searched further on the Internet, but the only utilities I found which could 
            install MBR code was for other operating systems, like FDISK.exe /MBR for DOS 
            (but I wouldn't boot to DOS...) or the fixmbr command in the Windows 
            2000/XP/2003 Recovery Console. Didn't want that either. Wanted something to 
            work on a Windows 32 bit platform, to be able to fix the problem in other cases 
            when using Win PE and just plain copying in the operating system 
            files.&nbsp;So, then I was left to make the utility myself!</P>
        <P>Problem solved: After booting up Windows PE from CD again, the command &nbsp; <FONT face="Courier New" size="2">
                <STRONG>MBRFix /drive 0 fixmbr /yes</STRONG></FONT> &nbsp; solved it all. 
            Embedded XP booted&nbsp;like a charm.</P>

        </pre>
        <H3>Readstate and Writestate:</H3>
        <P>The commands <EM>readstate</EM> and <EM>writestate</EM> use a byte at offset 
            0x1b2 to store state. This was changed from offset 0x1b0 used in earlier versions to be compatible with Windows Vista MBR.
            These commands&nbsp;are only useful in a scenario where you 
            use Windows PE to roll out other MS operating systems, and you <EM>have no other 
                place</EM> to store information about where you are in the installation 
            process. This location in the MBR is unused as far as known, from the days of DOS 3.30 until
            Vista.&nbsp;</P>
