Possible Scenario's 
- Boot from USB and Install XP in VHD located on NTFS drive of USB or HDD
- Boot with Grub4dos Menu on NTFS USB-Stick for Install of XP in VHD located on NTFS Drive of Internal Harddisk
- Boot with Portable USB-harddisk and Direct Install XP in VHD located on NTFS System Drive of USB-Harddisk

First Prepare XP Setup ISO file with integrated DriverPacks as described below in Section 2. How to prepare XP Setup Source ?
http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic=23553
and Copy XP Setup ISO file to the root of internal harddisk drive of your computer.

Direct Install of XP in VHD on USB requires to Integrate Wait4UFD driver in XP Setup Source
http://reboot.pro/topic/18107-integratedrv-install-xp-2003-to-a-usb-30-disk-and-boot-from-it/#entry167235

Selections to be made:
Boot Drive - FAT32 or NTFS - can be USB-stick so that there are no changes needed in the Windows installation on the internal harddisk
System Drive - NTFS - where VHD file is created e.g your internal harddisk drive
XP Setup ISO file - located on internal harddisk drive so that fast loading into RAM is enabled

Procedure to Make 2 GB VHD file and make Grub4dos Boot Menu on HDD or USB 
for Install of XP in VHD by using XP Setup ISO file and WinVBlock driver

0. Run VHD_XP_Setup.exe and Extract to simple path on internal Harddisk - gives folder VHD_XP_Setup
In Win 7/8 OS Set User Account Control Off and Reboot
1. Use imdiskinst.exe to Install ImDisk driver (if not present already)
- Imdisk is used to mount VHD and HDD Image files in a virtual drive
2. If desired use first UFD_FORMAT.exe to make USB-Stick bootable with Grub4dos Menu and that can be used as Target Boot Drive
- Then Run VHD_XP_Create.exe to create XPSRC1.vhd and Grub4dos Boot Menu for Install of XP in VHD
- Select Target Boot Drive and NTFS System Drive and select XP Setup ISO file located in root of Harddisk Drive 
3. Reboot and in Grub4dos menu select Start XP Setup on XPSRC1.vhd - WinVBlock driver
- XPSRC1.vhd has already NTFS compressed format, so you should NOT format at Setup, just keep settings
- Format XPSRC1.vhd inside XP Setup cannot be used, it results in corrupt message
4. After Reboot select Continue XP Setup and then Reboot to Start XP from Image XPSRC1.vhd

Option to Install 130 extra MassStorage drivers to make Universal XP VHD that can boot from USB on all hardware
When WINDOWS\DriverPacks store with subfolder M (MassStorage) for support of SCSI- en RAID-controllers is found in XP Source VHD,
then option MassStor of USB_XP_Fix.exe Or VHD_XP_Compact.exe will add CriticalDeviceDatabase registry and Services to allow booting on all hardware.

After XP Setup has finished then Boot with other Windows OS and use:
5. USB_XP_Fix.exe to enable booting from USB and to Install MassStorage drivers.
Select XPSRC1.vhd Image file and USB Boot Drive and click GO to create Grub4dos Boot Menu on USB Boot Drive.
If desired Copy XPSRC1.vhd to NTFS USB Drive for having Portable USB Drive booting with XP VHD.

Or
5. VHD_XP_Compact.exe - Make Portable XP in 1.2 GB VHD Or Mini XP in 0.6 GB VHD booting from Grub4dos Menu on USB or HDD
Make VHD with reduced size of XP and enable booting from USB and Install MassStorage drivers to boot from USB on all hardware.

Problems you may have
1. - VHD must be contiguous = unfragmented - Use WinContig to solve such problem.
2. - In case of VHD located on USB then some mobo will give VHD Disk 2048 MB No Access message in Partition Selection dialogue of XP Setup.
In that case reboot and in VHD_XP_Create.exe use Internal Harddisk drive as System Drive where to Create VHD for XP Setup.
It is important to use in that case XP Setup ISO without integrated Wait4UFD driver.
After XP Setup has finished then use USB_XP_Fix.exe to enable booting from USB and to Install MassStorage drivers.
Select XPSRC1.vhd Image file and USB Boot Drive and click GO to create Grub4dos Boot Menu on USB Boot Drive.
Copy XPSRC1.vhd to NTFS USB Drive for having Portable USB Drive booting with XP VHD.
3. VHD and XP Setup ISO file cannot be located on GPT partition - UEFI computers must be in BIOS compatible mode to enable booting with Grub4dos Menu.
Use MBR partition of HDD or USB as location for VHD and XP Setup ISO file.
4. In GUI-mode I386\asms not found error means that Virtual CD is not found in GUI-mode
Select Checkbox - Load XP Setup ISO in RAM might help to solve this issue.
Otherwise use WinNTSetup3 to prepare NT Setup folders in VHD mounted in ImDisk virtual drive - See Modified Procedure below


================================================================================

Modified Procedure to Make 2 GB VHD file and make NT Setup Grub4dos Boot Menu on HDD or USB and using WinVBlock driver.
First WinNTSetup3 is used with XP Setup ISO file to prepare XP Setup folders in VHD mounted in ImDisk virtual drive.

0. If desired use first UFD_FORMAT.exe to make USB-Stick bootable with Grub4dos Menu and that can be used as Target Boot Drive
1. Then Use VHD_XP_Create.exe where XP Setup ISO file is NOT Selected in this case.
Select Target Drives and Grub4dos Boot Menu Checkbox and use GO 
to make XPSRC1.vhd on NTFS System Drive and to make NT Setup Grub4dos Boot Menu on Target Boot Drive.
2. Mount XPSRC1.vhd as ImDisk Virtual Drive - if needed use imdiskinst.exe to Install ImDisk driver
3. Use WinNTSetup v3.2 - click on XP tab - Right-click to Select XP Setup ISO file
Select as Boot Drive and as Installation Drive the ImDisk Virtual drive of mounted XPSRC1.vhd
Click Setup to prepare $WIN_NT$.~BT and $WIN_NT$.~LS folders in XP VHD

Section 2. How to prepare XP Setup Source ? - Prepare XP Setup ISO file with integrated UpdatePack and DriverPacks

Take care that your XPSOURCE Folder is located on your Harddisk in a simple Path without SPACES.
Copy the Content of your Windows XP Setup CD to your XPSOURCE Folder on Harddisk 

First Integrate ServicePack SP3 in your XP-SP2 Source (don't use here nLite).
http://www.helpwithwindows.com/WindowsXP/Slipstreaming_Windows_XP_Service_Pack_3.html
Download from - http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=24

In Command Window use for English version and XPSOURCE folder on drive E:

WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe /integrate:E:\XPSOURCE

Siginet's RyanVM Integrator 1.6 can then be used to Integrate Windows UpdatePacks in the XP-Source. 
http://integrator.siginetsoftware.com/index.php?download
Download preferred version RVM Integrator 1.6.1 Beta 2.1

Windows XP UpdatePacks and Addons:
http://www.ryanvm.net/msfn/
http://www.ryanvm.net/msfn/updatepack-sp3.html
http://integrator.siginetsoftware.com/index.php?addons
http://www.ryanvm.net/forum/

For Install of XP on a modern system with SATA Drives it is needed to use DPsBase.exe 
for Integrating in your XPSOURCE DriverPack Massstorage with TXT Mode Enabled.
http://driverpacks.net/downloads
In that case a lot of Extra RAID SCSI and SATA Drivers (about 120 extra) are Integrated which appear in the 
XP Setup BootFolder $WIN_NT$.~BT on Install-Drive and can prevent a lot of XP Install Boot Problems.
Use DPsBase.exe to Integrate DriverPacks Chipset + Processor + MassStorage + LAN + WLAN DriverPacks
which will then be located in OEM Folder in your XPSOURCE folder.
(settings Disc - Method 2 - GuiRunOnce - Enable KTD for the DriverPacks I will Select)

Always first use RyanVM Integrator and then use DPsBase to Improve your XP-Source
DPsBase makes presetup.cmd in folder I386 and changes the I386\winnt.sif file for use of DriverPacks

presetup.cmd in folder I386 will start decompression of DriverPacks located in OEM folder 
at the beginning of GUI-mode of XP Setup, which does NOT take to much time for the 5 DriverPacks

You should select to Keep The Drivers for Chipset + Processor + MassStorage + LAN
Then WINDOWS\DriverPacks is about 135 MB which is acceptable and provides a lot of extra driver support 
which is useful to make XP Universal and adapt easily to very different hardware.
In that case the DevicePath is set accordingly in key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion 
so that XP can automatically make use of these drivers for adjusting to New Hardware

When you don't use nLite, you can copy the supplied $OEM$ folder to your XP Source folder
Change $OEM$ folder to your needs for UserAccounts and Registry Tweaks and Adding Drivers
CMDLINES.TXT is used for making UserAccounts and install of Registry Tweaks at T-12
Info see: http://unattended.msfn.org/unattended.xp/

Use DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe to Install from C:\Drivers at T-9 of GUI XP Setup (just for the last Reboot).
DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe was made by kickarse http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=110783
At end of TXT-mode XP Setup the folder $OEM$\$1\Drivers is copied to C:\Drivers
and $OEM$\$1\Install\DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe is copied to C:\Install
For Auto Use of DriverForge at T-9 add uncompressed driver folders in $OEM$\$1\Drivers
and Uncomment two rules by removing ; in winnt.sif file copied from winnt_sif to your I386 folder
This is very useful for Install of your well known Audio and Video driver during GUI-mode of XP Setup.

[SetupParams]
UserExecute = "%SystemDrive%\INSTALL\SetupPar.cmd"

Smart Driver Backup 2.12 of Jaque is very useful to Backup your drivers before install of XP
